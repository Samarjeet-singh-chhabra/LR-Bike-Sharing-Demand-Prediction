# **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction**
Exploring and analyzing from the dataset of Bike Sharing Demand to discover important factors that govern the bookings and predict using Machine learning algorithms the number of bike required at each hour of a day. This project will be performed with the help of Supervised Linear Regression model. We will be performing basic check on the data for any errors followed by EDA and at last we will train our Machine Learning model on the data to predict outputs for new inputs provided.

## Problem Statement
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

## Data provided
We have a dataset of bike rental information including Temperature, Humidity, Visibility, Windspeed, Dew point Temperature, Solar Radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall and number of bikes rented. All personal details have been removed. Data set has 14 columns and 8760 rows.
